a.   DOM (Document Object Model):

DOM is like a map that browsers create for web pages.
It represents the web page's structure as a tree, with each element
(like headings, paragraphs, images) as a branch in the tree. 
It allows developers to interact with and modify the content of a web page using JavaScript.

b.  Promises:

Promises are like guarantees for getting results from tasks that take time, 
like reading a file or making a network request. They represent the eventual outcome
(success or failure) of these tasks. With promises, 
developers can easily handle and chain these asynchronous tasks,
making code more organized and readable.

c.  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

OOP is a way of organizing code like playing with Lego blocks.
It groups together data and functions that belong to a specific "thing"
(like a person, car, or animal) into one package called an "object."
It helps developers create reusable and structured code, making it easier to
manage and extend their programs.

d.  Callback:

A callback is like leaving a phone number for someone to call you back. In programming,
a callback is a function you give to another function to be executed later when something is done.
It allows you to handle asynchronous operations (like reading files or getting data from a server) 
effectively without waiting for them to finish.
